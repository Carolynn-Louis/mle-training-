# Median housing value prediction

The housing data can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/. The script has codes to download the data. We have modelled the median house value on given housing data. 

The following techniques have been used: 

 - Linear regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest

## Steps performed
 - We prepare and clean the data. We check and impute for missing values.
 - Features are generated and the variables are checked for correlation.
 - Multiple sampling techinuqies are evaluated. The data set is split into train and test.
 - All the above said modelling techniques are tried and evaluated. The final metric used to evaluate is mean squared error.

## To excute the script

## Instructions to Execute the Script

To run the `main.py` script for predicting median housing values using different machine learning models, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Create and Activate a Conda Environment:
- conda env create -f env.yml
- conda activate mle-dev
- Make sure you're in the project root directory where main.py is located, then run
- python main.py
